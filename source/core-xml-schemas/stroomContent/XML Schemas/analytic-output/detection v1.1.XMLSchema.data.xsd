                    Recommended detector detail - name of detector.
                    This should be unique within the system.
                    Some detectors are very specific and only ever create one kind of detection, and in these cases it is likely that the name of the detector will be
                    very similar to the name of the detection headline that it creates.  Example: detectorSourceName="Bad Thing Detector" headline="Bad Thing Detected".
                    
                    However, it is possible to create detectors that are sufficiently configurable that they can create many kinds of detection.  
                    In these cases, this field should always be assigned to the same literal regardless of the detection/headline.
                    Example: detectorSourceName="Really Configurable Detector" headline="Good Thing Detected", and 
                    detectorSourceName="Really Configurable Detector" headline="Bad Thing Detected"
                      
                    For detectors that run within Stroom pipelines, the name of the XSLT can be specified here.

                    Recommended detector detail - version of detector.
                    This is the version of the detector identified in detectorSourceName field.  Different versions might produce different detections.
                    For detectors that run within Stroom pipelines, the version of the XSLT can be specified here.
                    Example: "v1.0"

                    Recommended detector detail - where the detector was deployed.
                    For analytics that run within Stroom itself, the name of the processing pipeline can be used.
                    Note: the XSLT function stroom:pipeline-name() can be used within Stroom XSLT processing to determine pipeline name.
                    Other analytics might run within an external processing framework, such as Apache Spark.
                    Example: "DevOps Spark Cluster"

                  <xs:documentation>
                    Required detection detail.
                    A high level description of what was detected.
                    This should be the same for all detections of a particular type, and should be easily understood.
                    It must be possible to search for all detections of this kind using just this one literal, e.g. for triage.
                    All detections of a particular kind can be expected to be triaged via the same process.  If it is likely that different triage processes may be
                    needed for different versions of the same detection, then these could be considered to be different kinds of detection, and therefore it might
                    be reasonable to produce more than one value for this field.
                    Example: "Charitable Donation Detected"

                  <xs:documentation>
                    Recommended detection detail.
                    A more detailed description of what was detected than provided by headline.
                    This will normally include some information relating to what triggered the detection, such as a specific device, location, or user.
                    In addition to descriptive text that will be the same for all detections of this kind, there are typically several possible variable dimensions that could
                    be used to populate parts of the string that is assigned to this field. 
                    Normally, only one such dimension is selected, based on the likely triage process (the kind of analysis that takes place, and principal area of interest of the analysts).
                    It should be possible to group by this field value to collect all detections that relate to the thing that the analysts are most interested in during triage.
                    Example: "Charitable Donation By 'Freya Bloggs' Detected" or "Charitable Donation To 'Happy Cats Cattery' Detected" depending on anticipated area of analyst interest
                    (perhaps philanthropic activities of individuals or financial transactions to organisations, respectively). 
                    
                    For some detections, this field will have the same value as that for headline as no further information is available.

                  Recommended detection detail.
                  Complete description of what was detected.  
                  This will normally include some detail relating to what triggered the detection.  All dimensions with ordinal (literal) values that are useful for triage are output.
                  Numeric and other continuous values such as timestamps are not included in this full description, in order that grouping by this single field will work effectively.
                  Example: "Charitable Donation By 'Freya Bloggs' to 'Happy Cats Cattery' Detected".
                  
                  For some detections, this field will have the same value as that for detailedDescription as no further information is available.

                <xs:annotation>
                  <xs:documentation>
                    This field does not need to be assigned.  Any assignment should be to a value that is sufficiently unique to identify a specific detection from a specific detector.
                    Typically, but not necessarily, the value of this field is a UUID.
                    It can be useful to assign this field in order to support analytic development / debugging.
                    It is necessary to assign this field if detectionRevision field is assigned a value.

                  <xs:documentation>
                    Can be used, in conjunction with detectionUniqueId to allow detectors that run continuously, 
                    in a streaming fashion to revise their detections in the light of new information.
                    For example, it might be useful to revise the same detection with additional linked events and a new standard deviation.
                    Where more than one detection has the same detectionUniqueId value, then the one with the highest detectionRevision will be the current one and
                    all previous revisions (lower numbers in detectionRevision field) are superceded / ignored.

                  <xs:documentation>
                    This field allows a detection to declare that all previous revisions (same detectionUniqueId, lower detectionRevision numbers) are now considered invalid.
                    For example, new data might arrive later than expected and invalidate a detection that has already been sent into Stroom.
                    Default value is false.

                    Individual dimensions or other properties associated with this detection should be defined as value elements.
                    These can be ordinal or continuous quantities and can refer either to properties of the detector (for example its configuration)
                    or refer to properties of the data that caused the detection (for example the name of devices or statistical quantities).
                    Example1: value[@name='device'] = "MyHost.MyOrg.com"
