      # Visualisations

      Stroom Visualisations Development is a test harness for working
      with the custom data visualisations used within Stroom dashboards.
      Stroom has the capability for custom JavaScript data visualisations
      to be added in at run time by end users. To allow for quick and
      easy development and testing of these visualisations this test
      harness was built. It currently generates randomised test data for
      each visualisation to enable development outside of Stroom. It also
      servers as the master repository for the visualisation scripts
      created for Stroom and the metadata files that accompany them.

      The custom visualisation framework in Stroom provides a means of
      adding any data visualisation that can be coded in JavaScript,
      without having to re-deploy a version of Stroom. Visualisations
      can be authored and managed by end users completely within the
      front-end of Stroom.

      The aim of the Stroom Visualisations is to provide a set of
      visualisations with a consistent look and feel that conform to the
      Stroom visualisations API. Stroom stores a lot of data and often you
      need to visualise data at multiple levels of grouping. As a result
      of this the concept of the gridded visualisation was created to
      enable each visualisation to be displayed as grid of multiple
      visualisations, with one group of data per grid cell.

      While these visualisations have been built for Stroom they are not
      tightly integrated with it and can easily be used in other
      applications as long as the data contract and API are met.
