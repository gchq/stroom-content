  "description" : "This pipeline is designed to allow one to split data into two output streams. Typically this is used to break event data into one stream that should be held for a different time period to that of another. For example, all user attributed events could go to one output stream held for 7 years and all others could go to another output stream that could be held for say 1 year."
