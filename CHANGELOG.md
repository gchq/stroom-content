# Change Log

A separate change log is kept in the root folder of each content pack directory, e.g. _./my-content-pack/CHANGELOG.md_.

##Warning... 

Do not attempt to use content with an incompatible Stroom version.

It is important to refer to [the compatibility matrix](README.md) in order to understand which versions of the content are
compatible with particular Stroom versions.   

If you wish to build an earlier version of a particular content pack, you will need to `git checkout` the appropriately
named git tag.
